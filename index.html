      <section aria-label="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Average plumbing cost analysis is best understood as a scope-based framework: diagnostics, access conditions, system interactions, and compliance steps drive the resources required for plumbing work. This approach supports consistent comparisons across common project types without treating outcomes as a single fixed number.</p>
        <p>In Georgetown, cost evaluations often reflect foothill housing patterns and seasonal weather effects. Freeze-prone runs in unconditioned spaces, mixed-era piping materials, and long or concealed routing can expand diagnostic time and increase the complexity of restoring a system to stable operation.</p>

  <section aria-label="Key Terminology">
    <h2>Key Terminology</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Scope boundary</dt>
      <dd>The defined limits of work based on where the defect begins and which connected components must be addressed to restore normal function.</dd>

      <dt>Diagnostic evaluation</dt>
      <dd>Methods used to confirm root cause, including visual inspection, functional checks, and targeted assessment of likely failure points.</dd>

      <dt>Access constraint</dt>
      <dd>Any condition that makes plumbing components difficult to reach, such as crawlspaces, tight chases, or buried runs.</dd>

      <dt>Material compatibility</dt>
      <dd>Matching fittings, pipe types, and connection methods so repairs integrate safely with existing system materials and configurations.</dd>

      <dt>Compliance alignment</dt>
      <dd>Documentation and workflow decisions that support permitting and inspection expectations when work changes permanent building systems.</dd>

  </section>

  <section aria-label="Process and Diagnostics">
    <h2>Process &amp; Diagnostics</h2>
    <p>A practical evaluation begins with defining the problem and limiting uncontrolled effects by isolating the relevant segment. In Georgetown, attention often focuses on exposed lines, transitions between materials, and areas where cold air exposure can stress fittings and valves.</p>
    <p>After diagnosis, the workflow is planned around compatibility, access, and verification. When work changes fixed plumbing systems, documentation and scheduling considerations may influence how the scope is executed and reviewed.</p>

  <section aria-label="Technical Standards and Local Context">
    <h2>Technical Standards &amp; Local Context</h2>
    <p>Plumbing work is evaluated for safe integration with supply, drainage, and venting behavior, as well as alignment with local review expectations when permanent system changes occur. In a foothill setting, additional attention may be required for freeze exposure, long runs, and system layouts that evolved over multiple renovation cycles.</p>
    <p>For formal reference material related to permitting and building review practices, consult <a href="https://www.cityofsacramento.org/Community-Development/Building">Sacramento Community Development building guidance</a>.</p>
